- Some methods have "inline" `schema` values, some have `$ref` `schema` values.
  Which is better? How do I know when to use one or the other?
  

- What is the difference between a `"$ref": "#/compontents/contentDescriptor/FilterId"` and a `"$ref": "#/components/schemas/Transaction"`
  (between _contentDescriptor_ and _schema_)?
  
  ...maybe `contentDescriptors` are for __results__? Only for them? Because they describe content, which, being returned, can't be assigned by the client?
  
  ...and `contentDescriptors` (at least for `FilterId`) can then use the _schema_ `"$ref"` in their definition.
  So I think that `components.schemas` is the "lowest common denominator" and "content descriptors" are
  "one level up", kind of like wrappers around those structures, and are used for non-assignable values.
  
  
  ... There is a `contentDescriptor` that is used in a `param` (`eth_newFilter`).
  Hypothesis broken.
  
  ... Thinking `contentDescriptors` are "wrappers" around `schema`s that
  just provide a little extra space for descriptive information, which can be used
  to contextualize the canonical schema.
